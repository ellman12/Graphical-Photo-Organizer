Remove a few useless things and address a few warnings.
Mute button now is only enabled when sorting is taking place.
Implemented a HashSet that stores the filenames in the destination folder. Should hopefully be more efficient than the old foreach loop every time an item was loaded.
Warnings are no longer given via MessageBoxes. Instead, a Label has been added in the main GUI to give warnings such as potential duplicate file, etc.
