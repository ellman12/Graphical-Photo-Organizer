Remove a few useless things and address a few warnings.
Mute button now is only enabled when sorting is taking place.
Implemented a HashSet that stores the filenames in the destination folder. Should hopefully be more efficient than the old foreach loop every time an item was loaded.
Warnings are no longer given via MessageBoxes. Instead, a Label has been added in the main GUI to give warnings such as potential duplicate file, etc.
GPO.xaml.cs has been massively cleaned up and de-spaghettied üçù.
GPO now supports files with extensions that aren't lowercase like MOV, JPEG, etc. Rare, but they happen.
When moving items to sorted folder/unknown DT folder, Threads are used instead of Task.Run. Seems to work better?
Change original and destination file paths from Labels to TextBlocks. This is because in Labels, any '_' characters are used for Alt acceleration. TextBlocks don't allow this. This makes the GUI look that much better, and my life easier.
